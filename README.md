<h2>Welcome to the revamp of Roku streaming platform</h2>

Building a video streaming ap using the IMBd AP and the assets created in Level 3, utilizing Node, Express and Vue to create the codebase for the app.
<br> The requirements are: 
<ul>
<li>need to design and build a temporary, very simple data store for your users and their
permissions. You’ll be replacing this with the UMS API you build in your Web class. You can
query this data directly via a route with Node and Express</li>
<li>A user should be able to log in/out, filter and use the API you built in your web class to select a
movie or tv show based on user profile (adult or kids). This means that you’ll have to figure out a
strategy to restrict access to some content based on age or ratings. Your users will need rights
and priveleges as well</li>
</ul>




<h2>Accessibility Features:</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Closed Captions: Closed captions are essential for users who are deaf or hard of hearing. They provide a text-based representation of the audio content of a video, enabling users to understand the content even if they cannot hear the audio.</p></li>
<li><p>Visual Indicators: Provide visual indicators for events such as starting and stopping a video, as well as any other important audio cues.</p></li>
<li><p>Transcripts: Providing transcripts of audio content is useful for users who prefer to read the content instead of listening to it.</p></li>
<li><p>Keyboard Accessibility: Ensure that all video and audio controls can be easily navigated with a keyboard, as some users may have difficulty using a mouse or other pointing device.</p></li>
<li><p>High Contrast: Use high contrast color schemes for the video and audio player, as well as any associated captions, to make it easier for users with low vision to distinguish them.</p></li>

</ul>
